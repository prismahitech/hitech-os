## arr5 fixes

- Adds governed GPU modes: `-GpuMode off|auto|on`.
- Keeps `off` as the reproducible default.
- Writes `gpu-profile.json`, `gpu-profile.md`, and `gpu-runtime.json` into the result ZIP.
- Names GPU comparison runs with `gpu-auto` / `gpu-on` in the result stem.

## arr4 fixes

- Adds `-Surface` selection without returning to the old `[REDACTED_ABSOLUTE_PATH]` motor.
- Supports aliases/ports: `pc/3130`, `tablet/3120`, `mobile/app/3140`, `web/3110`, `chart-lab/3000`, `control-center/3150`, `all`.
- Makes the final status honest:
  - `PASS`: all selected online targets captured with zero skipped/fail/missing.
  - `PARTIAL_PASS`: no real failures/missing records, but at least one selected macro/port was offline and got skipped.
  - `FAIL`: real capture failure, missing target record, Playwright crash, or zero records.
- Keeps `-Strict` for old red-gate behavior when skipped targets must fail the run.
- Discovery reports now include macro summaries, selected targets, filtered routes, dynamic skipped routes, port state and source files.
- Keeps the policy: no process kill, no process start, no DB, no deploy.

## arr5 fix2 GPU parser repair

- Repairs PowerShell parser failure in `core/run-surf8-capture.ps1` caused by escaped closing quotes in GPU markdown generation.
- Adds installer validation that parses installed PowerShell scripts through Windows PowerShell when available.
- Keeps GPU modes: `off`, `auto`, `on`; default remains `off`.


## arr5 fix2 validator repair

- Fixes the installer validator itself: PowerShell parse validation now runs through a temporary `-File` validator instead of passing target paths with spaces after `-Command`.
- This prevents false install failure on `F:
epos\hitech-os	ools\Plawright Mamastrophic\...`.
- Keeps the arr5 fix1 GPU string repairs and GPU modes `off|auto|on`.
# Atlasfin exact-target evidence

`RUN.ps1 -Mode point-probe` accepts `-Selector`, `-AuthoritySelector`,
`-ComponentUiId`, and `-EvidencePhase BEFORE|AFTER`. This additive mode keeps the
existing point probe and emits `reports/exact-target-evidence.json` plus a
target-only screenshot, computed styles, bounding box, sanitized DOM marker,
console/network diagnostics, and truthful state dispositions. It never clicks
the target or fabricates loading/focus/disabled product state.

Disabled exact-target baselines use `REAL_RUNTIME_DISABLED_BASELINE`; they are
never emitted as normal and a disabled hover observation never certifies enabled
hover. `RUN.ps1 -Mode state-fixture -ArtifactRoot <output-directory>` opens a
script-free local fixture and certifies enabled normal, enabled hover, keyboard
focus-visible, loading, reduced-motion, and disabled without product handlers,
navigation, sale, payment, API, or database work.

## Universal GitHub screenshot artifact fast path

The hosted fast path is `.github/workflows/mamastrophic-universal-screenshots.yml`. It is a thin operator/packaging adapter around this same Mamastrophic motor, not a second capture engine.

- surfaces: `pc`, `tablet`, `mobile` (existing Web/PWA surface), `web`, `chart-lab`, `control-center`, and `all`;
- modes: `screenshots` and `screenshotsqa`;
- `all` expands to six parallel surface jobs with one uploaded artifact per surface;
- Mamastrophic still owns discovery, Playwright capture, DeepScroll, route status and raw evidence;
- GitHub Actions owns only isolated CI runtime startup/prerequisites and artifact upload;
- `ci/build_universal_artifact.py` normalizes evidence without capturing, discovering routes or starting apps.

Portable runner rules:
- `RUN.ps1` resolves `powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`, `powershell`, or `pwsh`;
- when `ArtifactRoot` is provided, output paths derive from it and must not assume `F:\descargasf`;
- the Python launcher returned by `Get-PythonLauncher` is preserved as an argument array;
- normalized screenshot filenames are bounded and deterministic to avoid filesystem path-length failures.

The workflow is fail-closed: invalid/missing summary, nonzero capture exit, or screenshot-mode PASS/PARTIAL without PNG evidence becomes `FAIL`. Bounded partial scroll coverage is represented as `PARTIAL_PASS`, never silently upgraded to PASS.

See `docs/README_universal_screenshot_artifacts.md`.

# Chat 5 — ATLASFIN_BRIDGE status log

No updates published yet.


## 2026-09-04T19:50:29-06:00 — START
- Began using the canonical visual-promotion status channel for Chat 5 / ATLASFIN_BRIDGE.
- Read the complete status-channel README and STATUS_CHANNEL_CONTRACT.json.
- Confirmed status branch: `status/vp-chat-05-atlasfin`.
- Confirmed mailbox: `apps/terminal-de-venta-system/docs/ops/visual-promotion-parallel-status/chat-05-atlasfin/`.

## 2026-09-04T19:50:29-06:00 — PROGRESS
- Current work branch is `chat5-atlasfin-bridge-20260904`.
- Current work HEAD is `c5ef78edcc1bcb50ca7b108e316cdc0dbe1034d0`.
- Work base is `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`.
- PR #540 contains the bounded read-only Atlasfin promotion bridge under `prisma-html/extras/atlasfin/bridge/**`.
- Reused the existing 418-element Atlasfin catalog and current structured registries. No Atlasfin rebuild, product/runtime mutation, Identity/RIFAT mutation, Target Index mutation or Factory Ledger mutation was performed.
- Materiality Catalog remained `STANDBY_USER_INVOKED_ONLY` and was not inspected.

## 2026-09-04T19:50:29-06:00 — FINDING
- The bridge preserves separate authority domains for Atlasfin, Identity, RIFAT and NDC references.
- Missing worker candidate shards are represented as `PENDING_NOT_PRESENT`; partial or malformed shards are represented as `INVALID`.
- Current Cobrar exact-target evidence remains usable as a read-only reference, while Identity recipe IDs are not collapsed into Atlasfin recipe IDs.
- Optional VISCORE feed absence is kept explicit rather than converted into a synthetic status.

## 2026-09-04T19:50:29-06:00 — DECISION
- Chat 5 will not write `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json` because that file is outside the lane's allowed write ownership.
- Chat 5 will not merge PR #540 itself.
- Integration/composer ownership will handle global manifest parity and cohort integration.

## 2026-09-04T19:50:29-06:00 — VALIDATION
- CI: PASS.
- PRISMA Sync Sentinel Watch: PASS.
- ForgeOS Quality Gate: PASS.
- GVAE deterministic source/static suite: PASS, 134 tests, zero skips.
- GVAE mandatory registered-target mutation gate: PASS.
- Universal Visual Work Entry Gate: PASS.
- Fresh task-scoped Authority Mesh with native Layer Map: PASS.
- PRISMA HTML source validator: PASS.
- VISCORE architecture check: PASS.
- Identity Dictionary gate: PASS.
- RIFAT authority no-regression gate: PASS with no new regression.
- Atlasfin static gate: PASS, 27/27 pages, 20/20 tasks, zero issues.
- No-fake-READY gate: PASS.

## 2026-09-04T19:50:29-06:00 — BLOCKER
- PRISMA VISCORE1 Certification remains red only at the final committed `FILES_MANIFEST.json` parity step.
- Cause: five new Chat 5 bridge files are absent from the committed global manifest.
- This is an integration-only blocker, not a Chat 5 source/bridge failure.
- Generated manifest candidate artifact: workflow run `33936224670`, artifact `9960264654`, digest `sha256:54f10cb8d7d04b10de3af4feb58a25b1791f0758fab2552de020184dd78e7cdc`.

## 2026-09-04T19:50:29-06:00 — HANDOFF
- Lane state: `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- PR: https://github.com/prismahitech/hitech-os/pull/540
- Integration must preserve Chat 5 invariants: no automatic Materiality Catalog use, no second editable Atlasfin authority, no authority-domain ID collapse, no candidate-to-authority promotion, and no product/runtime writes from the bridge.
- No user action is currently required.


## 2026-09-04T20:16:00-06:00 — PROGRESS
- Re-read the updated canonical `PRISMA_VISUAL_PROMOTION_PARALLEL_CHAT_PROMPTS.md` and current Chat 5 mailbox.
- Confirmed current phase `INTEGRATION_HANDOFF_AND_PLANNING`.
- Confirmed Chat 5 is explicitly in HOLD and must preserve work branch `chat5-atlasfin-bridge-20260904`, work head `c5ef78edcc1bcb50ca7b108e316cdc0dbe1034d0`, PR #540 and base `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`.
- Re-read the updated interoperability contract, vocabulary registry and root AGENTS status-channel additions.

## 2026-09-04T20:16:00-06:00 — FINDING
- Canonical main is now `66fa02147f0cf31529c090a47f376026b406875a`.
- Bounded diff from the Chat 5 base shows only coordination/governance changes relevant to the cohort: status-channel plumbing, continuation prompt, status vocabulary/interoperability additions, AGENTS coordination instructions and corresponding FILES_MANIFEST bookkeeping.
- No Atlasfin catalog/registry input, Cobrar bridge evidence, Identity/RIFAT bridge contract, or Chat 5-owned bridge source changed on main.
- Therefore current main movement is `NON_RELEVANT_COORDINATION_ONLY` drift for Chat 5 and does not require bridge recomputation.

## 2026-09-04T20:16:00-06:00 — DECISION
- Stay `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` in HOLD.
- Do not rebase, regenerate, or mutate the Chat 5 work branch merely because main moved.
- Do not touch `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json`; final parity remains integration/composer-owned.
- Do not merge PR #540.
- Do not inspect or use Materiality Catalog.
- Only an explicit, bounded, evidence-backed integration correction request may reopen Chat 5 bridge mutation.

## 2026-09-04T20:16:00-06:00 — VALIDATION
- Continuation bounded drift revalidation: `PASS_NON_RELEVANT_COORDINATION_ONLY_DRIFT`.
- Compared base `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09` to current main `66fa02147f0cf31529c090a47f376026b406875a`.
- Existing Chat 5 validation evidence at work head remains preserved; no new lane mutation was performed.

## 2026-09-04T20:16:00-06:00 — HANDOFF
- Chat 5 remains ready for deterministic integration with exact frozen work head `c5ef78edcc1bcb50ca7b108e316cdc0dbe1034d0`.
- No user action is required.
- Waiting only for a bounded bridge correction request from the integration lane, if one is produced.


## 2026-09-04T23:44:00-06:00 — START
- Re-read the canonical continuation prompt and current Chat 5 mailbox.
- Current phase is `CANDIDATE_CORPUS_CERTIFICATION_PARALLEL`.
- Chat 5 assignment is `ATLASFIN CORPUS REFERENCE CERTIFICATION`.
- Current canonical main/base for the certification branch is `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`.
- New authorized work branch: `chat5/atlasfin-corpus-cert-20260904`.
- Write scope is only `prisma-html/extras/atlasfin/bridge/certification/**`.
- Exact raw surface worker heads will be consumed independently; no wait on Chats 1-4 certification branches.
- No PR is allowed for Chat 5 certification, no `FILES_MANIFEST.json` update is allowed, PR #540 remains unmerged, and Materiality Catalog remains entirely uninspected.


## 2026-09-04T23:51:17-06:00 — FINDING
- Exact raw source accounting was re-derived from the recorded worker heads: Tablet 929, PC 827, Mobile 271, Shared UI 70, total 2,097.
- The raw corpus contains 2,421 non-null Atlasfin refs: 2,097 adapter refs plus 324 recipe refs.
- All 2,421 normalized non-null refs validate against current structured Atlasfin authority. Hard invalid refs: 0.
- 341 representation-only normalizations are required, exactly Mobile 271 + Shared UI 70 qualified `atlasfin::` adapter values.
- Every normalized reference row preserves source head, source file, source line and deterministic source-record SHA-256.
- Re-derived review groups: table 66 Tablet + 105 PC, card 41 + 54, panel 20 + 27, overlay 11 Tablet only.
- Recipe equality remains review-only evidence and never authorizes semantic coalescing.

## 2026-09-04T23:51:17-06:00 — DECISION
- Certified strict representation for values inside `atlasfin.*` fields is the raw Atlasfin ID.
- A source value `atlasfin::<id>` may normalize to `<id>` only as representation, with the original serialized value retained in certification evidence.
- Authority-qualified evidence refs remain qualified.
- All-null and `NO_MATCH` records are excluded from semantic recipe coalescing.
- Materiality Catalog remains entirely uninspected.
- No certification PR, no `FILES_MANIFEST.json` update, no canonical promotion and no product/runtime mutation.

## 2026-09-04T23:51:17-06:00 — VALIDATION
- Certification work branch: `chat5/atlasfin-corpus-cert-20260904`.
- Certification base: `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`.
- Certification head: `6c7743f55434eb8d3429f286e2f9eae275d93d87`.
- Branch is exactly one commit ahead of base, zero commits behind at certification creation, and changes exactly six required files under `prisma-html/extras/atlasfin/bridge/certification/**`.
- `ATLASFIN_REFERENCE_CERTIFICATION.jsonl`: 2,421 rows, all `VALID_REFERENCE`.
- `INVALID_REFS.jsonl`: 0 rows.
- Representation normalizations: 341.
- Semantic mutations: 0.
- Source-record hashes: all valid 64-hex SHA-256 values.
- Materiality inspected: false.
- No PR exists for the certification branch.

## 2026-09-04T23:51:17-06:00 — COMPLETE
- Chat 5 Atlasfin corpus reference certification is complete and `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- Required outputs created:
  - `MANIFEST.json`
  - `NORMALIZATION_POLICY.json`
  - `ATLASFIN_REFERENCE_CERTIFICATION.jsonl`
  - `RECIPE_REVIEW_GROUPS.json`
  - `INVALID_REFS.jsonl`
  - `SUMMARY.md`
- No user action is required.

## 2026-09-04T23:51:17-06:00 — HANDOFF
- Chat 6 should consume `chat5/atlasfin-corpus-cert-20260904@6c7743f55434eb8d3429f286e2f9eae275d93d87` together with immutable raw worker heads and source bridge `chat5-atlasfin-bridge-20260904@c5ef78edcc1bcb50ca7b108e316cdc0dbe1034d0`.
- Final `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json` refresh remains Chat 6/integration-owned and must happen exactly once after accepted corpus bytes are assembled.

## 2026-09-11T22:45:00-06:00 — START
- Re-read current canonical main instructions and resolved the normative phase as `CORPUS_FINAL_PARALLEL_VERIFICATION`.
- Exact Chat 5 role is `ATLASFIN FINAL WITNESS`; expected result is `PASS_ATLASFIN_CORPUS_WITNESS` only if every immutable-head invariant reproduces.
- Read current Chat 5 mailbox before work and published `IN_PROGRESS` on the dedicated status branch.
- Immutable witness input is `chat5/atlasfin-corpus-cert-20260904@6c7743f55434eb8d3429f286e2f9eae275d93d87`.
- Current canonical main is `7c5b8d477a9006c5184ddbc806874b6e7c02571c`.
- Bounded comparison from certification base to current main shows coordination/governance movement without structured Atlasfin authority drift, so the immutable certification remains eligible for read-only revalidation.
- Materiality Catalog remains completely uninspected; product/runtime mutation and canonical promotion remain forbidden.

## 2026-09-11T23:02:00-06:00 — FINDING
- Immutable certification branch still resolves exactly to `6c7743f55434eb8d3429f286e2f9eae275d93d87`, with parent/base `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`.
- Source accounting reproduces 929 Tablet + 827 PC + 271 Mobile + 70 Shared UI = 2,097 source surface outcomes.
- Certification evidence reproduces 2,421 non-null Atlasfin reference rows: 2,097 adapter + 324 recipe references. `INVALID_REFS.jsonl` is the empty Git blob `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391`.
- Current structured Atlasfin recipe and adapter authority blobs remain exactly `af8dbff2cf22e0cb77163128af0358cd0a9d3762` and `f6eb2a32ff7a18ec80c6917654fc6d63c9024319`, matching certification provenance.
- Qualified Mobile and Shared UI adapter rows retain original `atlasfin::` serialization, normalized raw adapter IDs, source head/file/line/hash, `VALID_REFERENCE`, and `semanticMutation=false`.
- Recipe review groups reproduce card=95, table=171, panel=47, overlay=11 and declare `semanticCoalescingAllowed=false`; `ALL_NULL_ATLASFIN_REFS` and `NO_MATCH` stay excluded from automatic semantic coalescing.

## 2026-09-11T23:02:00-06:00 — VALIDATION
- Final witness result: `PASS_ATLASFIN_CORPUS_WITNESS`.
- Valid normalized Atlasfin references: 2,421/2,421.
- Hard invalid references: 0.
- Representation-only adapter normalizations: 341.
- Semantic mutations: 0.
- Provenance required fields are present in the certification evidence: `sourceHead`, `sourceFile`, `sourceLine`, `sourceRecordSha256`.
- Current main was rechecked at completion and remains `7c5b8d477a9006c5184ddbc806874b6e7c02571c`; no relevant structured Atlasfin authority drift was found.
- Materiality Catalog inspected: false.
- Product/runtime mutation: false.
- Canonical promotion: false.
- Global snapshot written by Chat 5: false.

## 2026-09-11T23:02:00-06:00 — DECISION
- Publish the deterministic witness receipt under `handoff.parallelWitness` in the Chat 5 mailbox.
- Snapshot acceptance criteria require Chat 6's read-only snapshot to reproduce the same 2,097 outcomes, 2,421 references, 341 representation-only normalizations, 0 semantic mutations, recipe-group partition and complete provenance, while failing closed on head/hash/shape mismatch.
- Any witness/snapshot mismatch is a hard stop for Chat 6, not a warning.
- Chat 5 now remains in `CERTIFIED_HOLD`; no source/certification/runtime/global-authority mutation is permitted by this phase.

## 2026-09-11T23:02:00-06:00 — COMPLETE
- Chat 5 current canonical assignment is complete.
- Status mailbox state is `DONE` with `handoff.parallelWitness.result = PASS_ATLASFIN_CORPUS_WITNESS`.
- No blocker and no user action remain for Chat 5.
- Chat 6 can read this deterministic mailbox directly; no owner relay is required.

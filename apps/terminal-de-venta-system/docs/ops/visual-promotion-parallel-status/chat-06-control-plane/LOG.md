# Chat 6 — VISUAL_PROMOTION_CONTROL_PLANE status log

No updates published yet.

## 2026-09-05T01:50:08Z — START

First report published under the canonical shared status channel. Chat 6 work had already started before the channel instruction. Base HEAD is `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`; work branch is `chat6/visual-promotion-control-plane-20260904`; observed work HEAD is `0a78a72f420def2cd9c843e2de08d9ae6b124f48`.

## 2026-09-05T01:50:08Z — PROGRESS

Implemented the deterministic Visual Promotion Control Plane under `prisma-html/tools/visual_promotion/**` and machine contracts under `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/contracts/**`. Added bounded Work Entry Gate hardening only in the two paths explicitly permitted to Chat 6. No product visual mutation and no Tablet/PC/Mobile/Shared UI candidate-shard population occurred.

## 2026-09-05T01:50:08Z — FINDING

The open PR workflow `PRISMA GVAE All-Surface Authority` auto-commits `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json` onto the Chat 6 branch. This is a global integration output forbidden to lane workers. The current work HEAD is a bot commit whose only changed file is that global manifest.

## 2026-09-05T01:50:08Z — DECISION

Treat the bot-authored global manifest as out-of-scope contamination, not as Chat 6 output. Preserve Atlasfin-first, Materiality `STANDBY_USER_INVOKED_ONLY`, current-census reuse, proposal-only canonical composition, and exactly four Work Entry decisions.

## 2026-09-05T01:50:08Z — VALIDATION

Task-exact Authority Mesh passed with 100% required-authority coverage, zero blockers and a Layer Map. The 134-test GVAE deterministic suite, Universal Visual Work Entry Gate, Target Index/Visual Core, RIFAT, Identity and Atlasfin source-static checks reached PASS in run `33936530294`. That run then failed only at the committed `FILES_MANIFEST.json` comparison. The all-surface authority workflow subsequently passed but auto-wrote the forbidden global manifest, which is the active blocker.

## 2026-09-05T01:50:08Z — BLOCKER

`AUTO_GLOBAL_MANIFEST_WRITE` active. Planned self-service resolution: close PR #541 so pull-request automation stops touching the lane branch, restore the manifest to base bytes, verify exact diff, and continue without waiting on other Chats.

## 2026-09-05T01:52:03Z — DECISION

Closed PR #541 to stop pull-request automation from repeatedly auto-committing the integration-owned `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json` onto the Chat 6 lane branch. This does not merge or promote Chat 6; it only removes the workflow mutation loop.

## 2026-09-05T01:52:03Z — BLOCKER_CLEARED

Restored `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json` exactly to the base-head blob and committed the cleanup on the work branch. Final work HEAD is `7cc48fa49906c8f443b267fd6c3590fd3f4340fb`. The global manifest is no longer present in the lane diff.

## 2026-09-05T01:52:03Z — VALIDATION

Final compare `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09..7cc48fa49906c8f443b267fd6c3590fd3f4340fb` contains exactly 14 changed paths, all under Chat 6 ownership plus the two explicitly permitted Work Entry files. No Tablet/PC/Mobile/Shared UI candidate shard, product runtime, global Identity/RIFAT registry, Target Index, global manifest or Materiality file remains changed.

## 2026-09-05T01:52:03Z — VALIDATION

The code tree `cb21ca01ecf8ec755fe34820d3d5b34673f70581` passed CI guardrails (`33936657370`), ForgeOS (`33936657565`), Sync Sentinel (`33936657351`) and GVAE All-Surface Authority (`33936657401`). VISCORE run `33936657471` passed the 134-test GVAE suite, mandatory gate, Universal Work Entry Gate, Target Index/Visual Core, fresh Authority Mesh, source validator, architecture/report smoke, Identity, RIFAT, Master Map/Code Atlas, Atlasfin and no-fake-READY checks; only its committed `FILES_MANIFEST.json` comparison failed, which is integration-owned by contract. Compare `cb21..7cc48f` reports zero file differences, so the final handoff tree is identical to that validated code tree.

## 2026-09-05T01:52:03Z — HANDOFF

Chat 6 initial Control Plane is `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`. Branch: `chat6/visual-promotion-control-plane-20260904`. HEAD: `7cc48fa49906c8f443b267fd6c3590fd3f4340fb`. Base: `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`. No user action is currently required. Later reconciliation waits only for explicit worker branch/commit refs and separate integration authorization.

## 2026-09-05T01:52:03Z — COMPLETE

Initial Chat 6 scope completed without product visual mutation, surface candidate writes, global canonical promotion, broad rediscovery or Materiality fallback. The lane remains stable for handoff; later cohort assembly must refresh `FILES_MANIFEST.json` once after accepted `prisma-html` bytes are assembled.

## 2026-09-05T02:15:00Z — START

Canonical continuation prompt re-read from `main` (blob `d9650c43542a89dcf4c6c787f32b36ef83541488`). Chat 6 is now in `DETERMINISTIC_INTEGRATION_PLANNING`, not hold. Current canonical `main` is `66fa02147f0cf31529c090a47f376026b406875a`.

## 2026-09-05T02:15:00Z — PROGRESS

Read all six current `STATUS.json` mailboxes. All report `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`. Exact worker heads from the canonical prompt are preserved: Chat 1 `1b669d98dc9063fe4d6f5f8ddc06262a6968e728`, Chat 2 `896f4a7f3463dc4ad1267f3e7d8f6a9fd70f4078`, Chat 3 `7f32ce6f1b602a14781fa2f4f3f323035f8029ec`, Chat 4 `57b502f1064571cebd917b36882ef9c11e9fa7d8`, Chat 5 `c5ef78edcc1bcb50ca7b108e316cdc0dbe1034d0`, Chat 6 `7cc48fa49906c8f443b267fd6c3590fd3f4340fb`.

## 2026-09-05T02:15:00Z — DECISION

Proceed with read-only deterministic validation/planning only. No broad rediscovery, no Materiality inspection, no global ID minting, no candidate promotion, no product/runtime mutation, no PR merge and no final `FILES_MANIFEST.json` refresh.

## 2026-09-05T02:29:00Z — FINDING

Direct Control Plane validation across the four surface shards found a real interoperability mismatch. Tablet 929/929, PC 827/827 and Shared UI 70/70 outcome rows pass the current structural/vocabulary/reference-envelope checks used so far. Mobile 271/271 does not: each row carries a top-level `projection` object not accepted by the current candidate schema, qualified `ndc::SURF.mb.owner_home` inside `ndcRefs` where the Control Plane expects a raw NDC ID, and unqualified repo/path entries inside `evidenceRefs`. Mobile also stores the Atlasfin adapter as `atlasfin::ADP.MB.TOUCH.V2` in the canonical Atlasfin field.

## 2026-09-05T02:29:00Z — BLOCKER

`CHAT3_CONTROL_PLANE_SCHEMA_INCOMPATIBILITY` recorded. No silent normalization or rewrite is authorized during planning.

## 2026-09-05T02:29:00Z — FINDING

Direct shard-manifest validation also exposes envelope drift: Chat 1 and Chat 4 omit the top-level input count expected by `validate_shard`; Chat 2 additionally declares legacy schema `prisma.visual-promotion.surface-candidate-manifest.v1`. Their row-level zero-loss accounting remains intact.

## 2026-09-05T02:29:00Z — FINDING

Current-main source/hash revalidation is clean for physical inputs: none of the worker-recorded product/RIFAT source/output paths changed between base `57b01ad8...` and current main `66fa0214...`. The main movement is coordination/governance drift, not physical-source drift.

## 2026-09-05T02:29:00Z — FINDING

Across all 2,097 outcome rows, exact Control Plane collision logic reports zero duplicate targets, zero binding-candidate-key collisions and zero cross-surface fingerprint collisions. However, the current fingerprint includes both `surfaceKey` and `targetId`, producing 2,097 singleton groups. Therefore zero collisions cannot be interpreted as proof of zero cross-surface semantic reconciliation need.

## 2026-09-05T02:29:00Z — DECISION

Preserve all worker heads exactly. Planning will describe bounded compatibility corrections separately and will not mutate candidate shards, canonical authority, runtime or global manifests.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — FINDING

The strict `candidate-shard-manifest.schema.json` uses `additionalProperties:false`, while runtime `validate_shard()` tolerates extra worker metadata. Therefore all four current rich worker manifests are non-conformant to the strict JSON Schema even when the runtime validator can partially consume them. This is a Control Plane contract/runtime divergence, not worker semantic drift.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — VALIDATION

Recorded authority snapshots were revalidated against current `main`: 33/33 Tablet/PC Git blob SHAs for Target Index, expanded Visual Control, Identity, projection manifest and Atlasfin registries match byte-for-byte. Base-to-main movement does not touch worker physical source/output authority.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — FINDING

Atlasfin Bridge worker intake is intentionally shallow: it checks only `candidateOnly`, valid `baseHead`, matching `surfaceKey`, and non-empty `targetId`. With all four exact shards present it can surface them as `PRESENT`, but that state is cockpit availability only and must not be interpreted as strict Control Plane candidate acceptance.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — VALIDATION

Exact net lane composition is 39 unique `prisma-html` paths: 37 additions and 2 modifications, with zero overlaps across Chats 1–6. This is the deterministic input path-set for the eventual one-time `FILES_MANIFEST.json` refresh; exact manifest bytes remain intentionally unknown until bounded compatibility corrections and owner acceptance are complete.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — FINDING

Aggregate candidate accounting is `2097 = 365 candidate + 1580 unresolved + 152 conflict`. Aggregate Work Entry is `2065 REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST + 32 BLOCKED`; there are zero `GVAE_EXACT_APPLY` and zero `SURFACE_BATCH_PLAN` decisions. Tablet alone has 139 `ELIGIBLE_CANDIDATE` promotion-status rows, but all 139 still have Work Entry `REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`; authorized canonical promotions remain zero.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — FINDING

Strong cross-surface semantic/NDC reconciliation groups proven by current canonical IDs: zero. Review-only Atlasfin recipe convergence exists for Tablet+PC: `REC.table.governed.v2` 171 rows (66+105), `REC.card.governed.v2` 95 (41+54), and `REC.panel.governed.v2` 47 (20+27). Recipe equality is visual-recipe evidence only, not proof of shared neutral meaning. All-null/no-match groups are excluded from reconciliation.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — DECISION

Recommended anti-rework path is a future bounded Chat 6 intake normalizer pinned to exact worker head/file hashes. It must transform only known syntactic envelope differences into the strict canonical in-memory schema, preserve original worker bytes and provenance, fail closed on unknown heads/hashes, and never upgrade semantics. A separate reconciliation review key must be added without weakening duplicate/collision fingerprints.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — HANDOFF

Deterministic `INTEGRATION PLAN` completed and embedded in the Chat 6 `STATUS.json` handoff. Exact assembly order is head-tree byte extraction (not history replay): Chat 6 Control Plane, Chat 5 read-only Bridge, then Tablet, PC, Mobile, Shared UI provenance in canonical surface order; normalized validation; Bridge rebuild; Current Truth/Surface Readiness; one `FILES_MANIFEST.json` refresh; full gates; then STOP before canonical mutation/merge.

## 2026-09-05T02:46:00Z — COMPLETE

Chat 6 continuation planning/validation phase is complete. State changed to `WAITING_EXTERNAL` because the canonical prompt explicitly requires stopping after the deterministic integration plan and waiting for repository-owner authorization. No product/runtime mutation, no candidate promotion, no global authority write, no PR #539/#540 merge, no Materiality read, no broad rediscovery, and no `FILES_MANIFEST.json` refresh occurred.

## 2026-09-05T05:44:00Z — START

Canonical prompt re-read from current `main` blob `07762a44523f864bfaf016d2db385f2434e507d7`. The prior integration-planning HOLD is superseded. Chat 6 is now executing `CANDIDATE_CORPUS_CERTIFICATION_PARALLEL`.

## 2026-09-05T05:44:00Z — PROGRESS

Created `chat6/candidate-corpus-cert-20260904` from current canonical `main` `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`. No lane source bytes have been changed yet.

## 2026-09-05T05:44:00Z — DECISION

Proceed only with the Chat 6-authorized Control Plane/global corpus scope. Preserve exact source heads and raw worker bytes, implement fail-closed exact-head/hash-pinned normalization, keep semantic reconciliation review separate from collision fingerprints, and retain the hard stop against canonical authority/product/runtime mutation.

## 2026-09-05T05:49:30Z — BLOCKER

Fresh AutoMesh run `33948117475` failed closed at universal preflight. Root cause is request construction, not repository drift: the request incorrectly required Chat 6 source-head-only files/directories as if they already existed on current `main`. Coverage stopped at 75%/66.6667% and no Mesh/composition ran.

## 2026-09-05T05:49:30Z — DECISION

Do not weaken coverage or bypass the gate. Resubmit a corrected task-exact request using only current-main authority paths and treat source head `7cc48fa49906c8f443b267fd6c3590fd3f4340fb` as immutable provenance to be imported after authority passes.

## 2026-09-05T05:52:00Z — BLOCKER_CLEARED

Corrected fresh task-exact AutoMesh run `33948191110` completed successfully on current `main` `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`: `PASS_COMPOSED_AUTHORITY_MESH`, blockers empty. GitHub artifact `9964001762`, digest `sha256:94e24c6e34d49038c401c1622e647cd48edb147a228b2ab685bb112196846d0a`; composed authority payload SHA-256 `0918d3228415d4beeb760083ae64e293fa2cc31b19bc2b4a1b01a0e4fd047d1f`.

## 2026-09-05T05:52:00Z — VALIDATION

Universal preflight, task-exact parallel Mesh and composed authority all passed. The previous request-construction blocker is cleared without weakening coverage or bypassing fail-closed behavior.

## 2026-09-05T05:59:00Z — PROGRESS

Global certification tooling reached source-ready intake state on work head `2285101755a0859681cfe23d45db9b96b2beea53`. Prior Chat 6 bytes were brought forward by exact Git blob identity, not history replay. The new machine registry pins all four original worker heads and every raw shard file used by certification.

## 2026-09-05T05:59:00Z — DECISION

Known representation differences are normalized only in derivative data. Product-path and Git-history evidence is lifted into certification provenance instead of being mislabeled as canonical authority. Candidate collision fingerprints remain unchanged; semantic review keys are separate and never auto-coalesce meaning.

## 2026-09-05T05:59:00Z — VALIDATION

Exact worker-head sample fixtures now cover Tablet, PC, Mobile and Shared UI normalization paths. The full 2,097-record execution is intentionally deferred until raw worker bytes are assembled on the cohort integration tree, where the generator can verify registered file hashes before reading records.

## 2026-09-05T05:59:00Z — PROGRESS

Per canonical phase protocol, Chat 6 may now re-read Chats 1-5 status mailboxes and consume only explicit certification handoffs.

## 2026-09-05T05:56:00Z — PROGRESS

Exact Chat 6 Control Plane bytes from source head `7cc48fa49906c8f443b267fd6c3590fd3f4340fb` were brought forward onto corpus-certification work head `131c38980343d5892e1341e5fd919fc8c81a3095` by head-tree extraction, not history replay.

## 2026-09-05T05:56:00Z — BLOCKER

Canonical `main` advanced from `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2` to `1cc4d0d45b3878ace2906d08fa67f325a3b98a9d`. Per AutoMesh v2, further governed mutation is paused pending revalidation of artifact `9964001762` / digest `sha256:94e24c6e34d49038c401c1622e647cd48edb147a228b2ab685bb112196846d0a`.

## 2026-09-05T06:18:30Z — FINDING

Current canonical prompt blob `4bb50fea55da73ed1f194bfd9a52a7aad2486f39` advances the cohort to `CANDIDATE_CORPUS_FINAL_AGGREGATION`. Chats 1-5 are certified hold; Chat 6 is the only active assembly lane.

## 2026-09-05T06:18:30Z — BLOCKER_CLEARED

AutoMesh v2 revalidation run `33949261013` classified the prompt movement as `BLOCKED_RELEVANT_DRIFT`, executed the mandatory full refresh, and finished `PASS_FULL_MESH_REFRESH_AFTER_RELEVANT_DRIFT`. Fresh composed authority is bound to `1cc4d0d45b3878ace2906d08fa67f325a3b98a9d`, request digest `421929585a3d9e5b7be508b2cf7b595c244322239890390415eacb29eab4c4ab`, composed artifact SHA-256 `c915ff04124922595333836a393eb9fb25ccd7e6442c3e2b36a3949751eb17a4`.

## 2026-09-05T06:18:30Z — VALIDATION

Universal Factory Ledger anti-rework gate: PROPOSAL = `PASS_ANTI_REWORK_GATE`; MUTATION = `PASS_ANTI_REWORK_GATE`. Canonical capability `visual.generic_application_engine_v1` remains `DONE / SOURCE_READY / doNotRebuild=true`, action `ADVANCE`. No rebuild is authorized or attempted.

## 2026-09-05T06:41:00Z — FINDING

The Chat 6 work branch already contained concurrent corpus-certification implementation. It was audited and reused rather than rebuilt. Current controlled work head after bounded handoff hardening is `9fdc3545d8b3309395f9276723c81f9799b1c60f`.

## 2026-09-05T06:41:00Z — VALIDATION

Independent surface certification audit PASS: Tablet `929/929`, PC `827/827`, Mobile `271/271`, Shared UI `70/70`. Across all `2,097` records: semantic mismatches `0`, source head/file/line/record-hash mismatches `0`, invalid certification statuses `0`, semanticMutation violations `0`.

## 2026-09-05T06:41:00Z — FINDING

Tablet legitimately omits the optional `schema` field in its owner-certified derivative while Chat 6 may explicitly add it during global normalization. The intake verifier was corrected to require strict candidate validity plus semantic fidelity, not false byte/object identity.

## 2026-09-05T06:41:00Z — VALIDATION

Chat 5 Atlasfin certification PASS independently: `2,421/2,421` reference rows cross-link exactly to the `2,097` owner-certified source records; invalid refs `0`, source provenance mismatches `0`, semantic mutations `0`. The apparent digest mismatch was not a defect: its manifest deliberately uses canonical JSON/substructure digest bases for policy/groups.

## 2026-09-05T06:41:00Z — PROGRESS

Added exact certification-head/file hash registry and final handoff verifier under Chat 6 ownership. Every owner certification row will be hash-pinned into final global certification provenance. No canonical promotion, product/runtime mutation, broad rediscovery or Materiality read occurred.

## 2026-09-05T06:20:00Z — BLOCKER_CLEARED

AutoMesh v2 revalidation run `33949261013` passed on current `main` `1cc4d0d45b3878ace2906d08fa67f325a3b98a9d`. The relevant prompt/manifest drift was not ignored.

## 2026-09-05T06:20:00Z — VALIDATION

Fresh task-exact AutoMesh run `33949294075` also passed `PASS_COMPOSED_AUTHORITY_MESH` on the same HEAD. Required authority coverage is 100%, blockers=0 and Layer Map evidence exists for both Chat 6 tasks. Request digest `5cd15e40ea840664e61fc9683f0726dc28d330303f527fc8bd192c7a3b82a7c7`; composed artifact SHA-256 `38d052092ad9f67f058e9e1412b4d47b05680c22ac2e903ff7438e9ded4301bc`.

## 2026-09-05T06:20:00Z — VALIDATION

Universal anti-rework gate passed in both `PROPOSAL` and `MUTATION` modes for canonical capability `visual.generic_application_engine_v1` with requested action `ADVANCE`. Ledger truth remains `DONE / SOURCE_READY / doNotRebuild=true`; GVAE will not be rebuilt.

## 2026-09-05T06:20:00Z — DECISION

Bounded Chat 6 corpus/control-plane mutation is now permitted. Certification inputs are fixed to the exact five heads in the current canonical prompt. Existing unresolved/conflict semantics are valid corpus states and will be preserved.

### 2026-09-12T04:45:00Z — START
- Resumed Chat 6 under `CORPUS_FINAL_PARALLEL_VERIFICATION` as `GLOBAL_COMPOSITOR_INTEGRATOR`.
- Canonical main: `7c5b8d477a9006c5184ddbc806874b6e7c02571c`.
- Current corpus work branch/head: `chat6/candidate-corpus-cert-20260904@73fb33e42eeb2aa66a0816bcffc2d59fab54d876`.
- Existing integration branch is treated as evidence only until current-head authority is revalidated and exact assembly is proven against current main.
- Materiality Catalog remains uninspected; product/runtime mutation and canonical promotion remain forbidden.

### 2026-09-12T06:40:00Z — VALIDATION
- Read Chats 1–5 witness receipts directly from their mapped status branches.
- PASS receipts present: Tablet, PC, Mobile, Shared UI, Atlasfin.
- Exact immutable certification heads match the canonical continuation pins.
- No witness reports a certification defect; preserved blockers/conflicts remain intentional corpus states, not witness failures.
- AutoMesh v2 revalidation was triggered for prior artifact `9964303227` against current canonical `main` before any new governed integration mutation.

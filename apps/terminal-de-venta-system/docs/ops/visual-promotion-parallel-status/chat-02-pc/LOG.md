# Chat 2 — PC_PROMOTION status log

No updates published yet.

## 2026-09-04T19:51:32-06:00 — START

- Status-channel reporting enabled for Chat 2 / PC_PROMOTION.
- Assigned status branch: `status/vp-chat-02-pc`.
- Assigned mailbox: `apps/terminal-de-venta-system/docs/ops/visual-promotion-parallel-status/chat-02-pc/`.
- Existing worker task was already completed before this coordination channel was introduced; this entry records that current truth rather than replaying work.

## 2026-09-04T19:51:32-06:00 — FINDING

- Work branch is `agent/chat2-pc-promotion-20260904` at `896f4a7f3463dc4ad1267f3e7d8f6a9fd70f4078`.
- Work base is `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`.
- PC census accounting is 827 input = 186 candidate + 640 unresolved + 1 conflict.
- Physical status is 826 CURRENT / 1 DRIFT.
- Atlasfin-first status is 186 MATCHED_RECIPE / 641 NO_MATCH.
- Projection status is 688 CURRENT / 139 MISSING / 0 DRIFT.
- Current main has advanced to `d08013db42c34ccafb80075392ec6d7a289cf7b5`; integration must revalidate relevant authority hashes rather than silently upgrading stale evidence.

## 2026-09-04T19:51:32-06:00 — BLOCKER

- Candidate `TGT.CENSUS.PC.097AB2F857F353CA4288.V1` has a current-authority selector disagreement: Target Index `.supplier-readable-v07` vs expanded Visual Control `.supplier-readable-v07 *`.
- The record remains blocked/conflicted. No broad rediscovery or repair was performed. The worker lane itself is not blocked.

## 2026-09-04T19:51:32-06:00 — DECISION

- Reuse current census; no broad rediscovery.
- Atlasfin remains the priority visual reference; Materiality Catalog remains `STANDBY_USER_INVOKED_ONLY` and was not inspected or used.
- No canonical IDs were minted. No NDC meaning was inferred from visual names. No projection/source gap was repaired.

## 2026-09-04T19:51:32-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Zero-loss accounting: PASS.
- Unique target IDs: PASS.
- Closed vocabulary / authority-domain validation: PASS.
- Write ownership: PASS, exactly five candidate-shard files under the Chat 2 PC directory.
- Product/runtime writes: 0.
- Global authority writes: 0.
- Broad rediscovery: NOT_RUN.
- Materiality fallback: NOT_USED.
- Work branch head verification: PASS, branch is identical to `896f4a7f3463dc4ad1267f3e7d8f6a9fd70f4078`.

## 2026-09-04T19:51:32-06:00 — HANDOFF

- Lane state: `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- Handoff root: `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/pc/`.
- Files: `MANIFEST.json`, `CANDIDATES.jsonl`, `UNRESOLVED.jsonl`, `CONFLICTS.jsonl`, `SUMMARY.md`.
- Integration must preserve unresolved/conflict truth and revalidate base/source hashes against current main before accepting mixed-base data.

## 2026-09-04T19:51:32-06:00 — COMPLETE

- Chat 2 worker work is complete and available for deterministic integration review.
- This status is coordination evidence only. It does not grant binding authority, mutation authority, runtime certification or Factory Ledger maturity.

## 2026-09-04T19:52:29-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Status-channel isolation: PASS.
- `status/vp-chat-02-pc` is 2 commits ahead / 0 behind current `main`.
- Diff is limited to this Chat 2 mailbox's `STATUS.json` and `LOG.md`.
- Required STATUS fields: PASS, none missing.
- LOG append-only preservation: PASS; seed history remains intact and the completion timeline was appended.

## 2026-09-04T20:15:30-06:00 — PROGRESS

- Canonical parallel prompt re-read after continuation update.
- Chat 2 is now explicitly in `PC HOLD`.
- Worker branch/head/base and accounting remain fixed: `agent/chat2-pc-promotion-20260904` @ `896f4a7f3463dc4ad1267f3e7d8f6a9fd70f4078`, base `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`, accounting `827 = 186 + 640 + 1`.
- Lane resumed only to perform the newly required bounded read-only source/authority hash revalidation against current integration base.
- Candidate shard regeneration, projection repair, broad rediscovery and product/global-authority mutation remain forbidden.

## 2026-09-04T20:19:17-06:00 — FINDING

- Current canonical `main` is `66fa02147f0cf31529c090a47f376026b406875a`.
- Bounded revalidation checked the exact PC worker-manifest provenance against current `main`: 28/28 recorded source-authority Git blob SHAs match.
- Relevant source/authority drift count: 0.
- Base-to-main changed paths are coordination/prompt/status-channel/global-manifest bytes; none of the 28 PC candidate source-authority inputs changed.
- Interoperability contract changed only by adding the status-channel write exception.
- Core promotion vocabulary is semantically unchanged; only `coordinationStatusChannel` was added.

## 2026-09-04T20:19:17-06:00 — DECISION

- Classify current main movement for Chat 2 as `NON_RELEVANT_COORDINATION_ONLY`.
- Do not regenerate, rebase or mutate the PC candidate shard.
- Preserve the 139 projection `MISSING` records and the one selector conflict exactly as recorded.
- Return to `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` / PC HOLD.

## 2026-09-04T20:19:17-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Source-authority hash revalidation: PASS, 28/28 exact blob matches.
- Interoperability semantic stability: PASS, status-channel addition only.
- Vocabulary semantic stability: PASS for scope, authority domains, ID policies, fields, enums, NDC edges, Atlasfin sources, Materiality policy, ownership, forbidden writes and hard truths.
- Worker branch immutability: PASS, `agent/chat2-pc-promotion-20260904` remains exactly `896f4a7f3463dc4ad1267f3e7d8f6a9fd70f4078`.
- Five worker output blob SHAs: PASS, unchanged.

## 2026-09-04T20:19:17-06:00 — HANDOFF

- Chat 2 remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- Current integration base checked: `66fa02147f0cf31529c090a47f376026b406875a`.
- Revalidation classification: `NON_RELEVANT_COORDINATION_ONLY`.
- Candidate mutation required: false.
- Future action is HOLD unless deterministic integration requests one bounded correction backed by stronger authority/evidence.

## 2026-09-04T20:20:36-06:00 — FINDING

- Factory Ledger capability `visual.generic_application_engine_v1` remains `DONE / SOURCE_READY / doNotRebuild=true`.
- Its current next gate preserves the universal Visual Work Entry model: census `DISCOVERY_ONLY` must `REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST` or remain blocked; physical census alone is not application authority.

## 2026-09-04T20:20:36-06:00 — DECISION

- Chat 2 continuation is classified as bounded `VERIFY/REUSE` only.
- No GVAE rebuild, BUILD/REBUILD, mutation gate, candidate regeneration or product/global-authority mutation is warranted.
- PC lane remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` in HOLD.

## 2026-09-04T23:43:30-06:00 — START

- Canonical prompt re-read. Current phase is `CANDIDATE_CORPUS_CERTIFICATION_PARALLEL`.
- Assigned lane remains Chat 2 / `PC_PROMOTION`.
- Immutable source provenance: `agent/chat2-pc-promotion-20260904` @ `896f4a7f3463dc4ad1267f3e7d8f6a9fd70f4078`, source base `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`.
- Input accounting is fixed: `827 = 186 candidates + 640 unresolved + 1 conflict`.
- New certification branch required: `chat2/pc-corpus-cert-20260904`.
- Allowed lane writes are restricted to `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/pc/certification/**`.
- Source worker bytes are immutable evidence. Certification is a derivative only.
- Required completion remains 827/827 corpus-valid, invalid=0, semanticMutationCount=0, selector conflict preserved, 139 projection MISSING preserved.

## 2026-09-04T23:49:00-06:00 — FINDING

- Precommit PC corpus certification passed against the exact strict candidate schema from Control Plane head `7cc48fa49906c8f443b267fd6c3590fd3f4340fb`.
- All `827/827` source records are already strict candidate representations.
- The legacy compatibility gap is the PC source manifest/count envelope, not candidate semantic fields.
- Certification labels are `827 VALID_REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`. Source bucket placement does not upgrade promotion readiness.
- Preserved counts: physical `826 CURRENT / 1 DRIFT`; projection `688 CURRENT / 139 MISSING`; Atlasfin `186 MATCHED_RECIPE / 641 NO_MATCH`; NDC `827 UNRESOLVED`; Identity binding `827 BLOCKED`.
- Invalid records: 0. Duplicate target IDs: 0. semanticMutationCount: 0.

## 2026-09-04T23:49:00-06:00 — DECISION

- `NORMALIZED.jsonl` will preserve every source record byte-for-byte because no field-level normalization is required for PC.
- Only the legacy shard manifest envelope is normalized to `prisma.visual-promotion.candidate-shard.v1`.
- Deterministic per-record provenance hash rule: SHA-256 over the exact UTF-8 JSON record bytes excluding the line terminator.
- No projection repair, semantic inference, binding resolution, Atlasfin upgrade, canonical ID minting, Materiality use or product/global-authority mutation.

## 2026-09-04T23:56:00-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Post-commit certification revalidation: `PASS_POSTCOMMIT_PC_CORPUS_CERTIFICATION`.
- Certification branch: `chat2/pc-corpus-cert-20260904`.
- Branch base: `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`.
- Final certification head: `8cc979c141000fcedabf832f16468a6ee3e328e2`.
- Branch delta: 5 commits ahead / 0 behind base; exactly five changed paths, all under the owned `pc/certification/**` root.
- Committed corpus: 827 normalized records, 827 certification rows, invalid=0, unique targets=827.
- `semanticMutationCount=0`; `representationChangedCount=0`; source provenance complete.
- Preserved: `826 CURRENT / 1 DRIFT`, `688 projection CURRENT / 139 MISSING`, `186 MATCHED_RECIPE / 641 NO_MATCH`, `827 NDC UNRESOLVED`, `827 binding BLOCKED`, `827 REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`.
- Certification labels: `827 VALID_REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`.
- Exact selector conflict remains `.supplier-readable-v07` vs `.supplier-readable-v07 *`.
- Raw worker branch remains byte/history immutable at `896f4a7f3463dc4ad1267f3e7d8f6a9fd70f4078`.

## 2026-09-04T23:56:00-06:00 — HANDOFF

- Result: `PASS_PC_CANDIDATE_CORPUS_CERTIFIED`.
- Chat 6 should consume `chat2/pc-corpus-cert-20260904@8cc979c141000fcedabf832f16468a6ee3e328e2` by exact head/tree.
- Output root: `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/pc/certification/`.
- No Chat 2 PR was opened. No `FILES_MANIFEST.json` update was made.
- Corpus validity does not authorize canonical promotion, binding resolution, projection repair, GVAE APPLY or runtime readiness.

## 2026-09-04T23:56:00-06:00 — COMPLETE

- Chat 2 PC corpus-certification lane is complete and `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- No user action is required.
- Further writes are blocked by lane policy unless deterministic integration requests a bounded evidence-backed certification correction.

## 2026-09-11T22:44:00-06:00 — START

- Canonical continuation phase re-read from repository truth: `CORPUS_FINAL_PARALLEL_VERIFICATION`.
- Chat 2 resolves to `PC_PROMOTION`, role `PC_FINAL_WITNESS`, status branch `status/vp-chat-02-pc`, expected result `PASS_PC_CORPUS_WITNESS`.
- Witness source is immutable read-only head `chat2/pc-corpus-cert-20260904@8cc979c141000fcedabf832f16468a6ee3e328e2`.
- No source/certification/product/runtime/global-authority mutation is authorized. Only this mailbox may be written.

## 2026-09-11T22:49:00-06:00 — FINDING

- Exact certification head tree contains the five expected certification outputs with immutable Git blobs: MANIFEST `bc53a0e1d92df2092248bacfb9ca042b65e188e2`, NORMALIZED `d7e7c730342a24d3daeadb3f9b07cfd95278c0b0`, CERTIFICATION `9c0517f3e098cdf0c02aa52aa469bbf04b4264d7`, INVALID `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391`, SUMMARY `3f57f5c9b96fc57ec665e58a5809aaee9e0f1dc0`.
- Immutable MANIFEST/SUMMARY report NORMALIZED=827, CERTIFICATION=827, INVALID=0, duplicateTargetIds=0, semanticMutationCount=0, labels=827 `VALID_REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`, physical=826 CURRENT + 1 DRIFT, projection=688 CURRENT + 139 MISSING.
- Certification row for `TGT.CENSUS.PC.097AB2F857F353CA4288.V1` is the final normalized line 827, source bucket `CONFLICTS` line 1, with source/normalized SHA-256 equal and `representationChanged=false`; validation fields are PASS and `semanticMutation=false`.
- The corresponding normalized record remains `physicalStatus=DRIFT`, carries blocker `current-authority-selector-disagreement`, and preserves the exact note: target-index `.supplier-readable-v07` vs expanded `.supplier-readable-v07 *`.
- A projection-MISSING record remains present at the tail of the immutable normalized corpus; certification summary explicitly states all 139 MISSING records remain MISSING.

## 2026-09-11T22:51:00-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Exact certification head identity: PASS.
- Five output Git blob identities: PASS and match the prior deterministic handoff.
- NORMALIZED count 827 / CERTIFICATION count 827 / INVALID 0: PASS from immutable certification outputs.
- Unique target IDs 827 / duplicateTargetIds 0: PASS from immutable certification summary and post-commit certification evidence.
- semanticMutationCount=0: PASS; hard conflict row independently shows semanticMutation=false and hash-preserving normalization.
- Certification labels 827 `VALID_REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`: PASS.
- Physical partition 826 CURRENT + 1 DRIFT: PASS.
- Projection partition 688 CURRENT + 139 MISSING: PASS; no MISSING repair is claimed or observed in certification truth.
- Selector conflict target remains unresolved exactly: PASS.
- Provenance completeness: PASS; certification contract records source branch/head/base/file/bucket/line, file Git blob SHA, file SHA-256, source-record SHA-256, normalized line/hash and per-row sourceProvenance validation.
- Materiality Catalog inspected: false.
- Product/runtime mutation: false.
- Canonical promotion performed: false.

## 2026-09-11T22:52:00-06:00 — DECISION

- All canonical Chat 2 final-witness invariants pass against immutable head-tree evidence.
- Publish `PASS_PC_CORPUS_WITNESS` under `handoff.parallelWitness` and enter `CERTIFIED_HOLD`.
- Do not repair the selector conflict, the 139 projection MISSING records, or any unresolved semantic/binding state.

## 2026-09-11T22:53:00-06:00 — HANDOFF

- Result: `PASS_PC_CORPUS_WITNESS`.
- Certification head: `8cc979c141000fcedabf832f16468a6ee3e328e2`.
- Expected input count: 827.
- Exact defects: none in corpus witness invariants; the known selector conflict remains intentionally unresolved evidence, not a witness defect.
- Receipt is coordination evidence only. It does not authorize canonical promotion, projection repair, GVAE APPLY, product/runtime mutation or runtime visual READY.

## 2026-09-11T22:53:00-06:00 — COMPLETE

- Chat 2 current assignment is complete.
- State after completion: `CERTIFIED_HOLD` represented by mailbox state `DONE` plus the deterministic `handoff.parallelWitness` receipt.
- No user action required. Await only a bounded evidence-backed correction request from the global compositor if a real witness mismatch is later proven.

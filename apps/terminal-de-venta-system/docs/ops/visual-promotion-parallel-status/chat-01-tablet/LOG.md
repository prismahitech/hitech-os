# Chat 1 — TABLET_PROMOTION status log

No updates published yet.

## 2026-09-04T19:54:52-06:00 — START

- Chat 1 adopted the canonical shared status channel.
- Lane: `TABLET_PROMOTION`.
- Status branch: `status/vp-chat-01-tablet`.
- Mailbox ownership: `apps/terminal-de-venta-system/docs/ops/visual-promotion-parallel-status/chat-01-tablet/` only.
- Existing work was already complete before this reporting channel was introduced, so this first entry records the current truthful state rather than pretending the lane restarted.

## 2026-09-04T19:54:52-06:00 — PROGRESS

- Work base: `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`.
- Work branch: `chat1/tablet-visual-promotion-57b01ad8`.
- Work HEAD: `1b669d98dc9063fe4d6f5f8ddc06262a6968e728`.
- Chat 1 wrote only the five files under `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/tablet/`.
- No product/runtime, global visual authority, Target Index, Identity registry, Factory Ledger, Web, Chart Lab, Control Center, PC, Mobile, Shared UI, or other Chat mailbox writes were made.

## 2026-09-04T19:54:52-06:00 — FINDING

- Input census count: **929** `VISUAL_CONTROL_CENSUS_TARGET` records.
- Outcome accounting: **139 candidates + 788 unresolved + 2 conflicts = 929**.
- Physical: **927 CURRENT / 2 DRIFT**.
- Projection: **929 CURRENT**.
- Atlasfin: **138 MATCHED_RECIPE / 789 NO_MATCH / 2 NOT_APPLICABLE**.
- NDC: **929 UNRESOLVED**, intentionally, because no direct existing NDC authority link was proven.
- Existing Identity binding reused exactly once on selector + implementation-layer equality.

## 2026-09-04T19:54:52-06:00 — DECISION

- Atlasfin-first remains in force.
- Materiality Catalog remains `STANDBY_USER_INVOKED_ONLY`; it was not inspected and no fallback was used.
- Broad rediscovery remains forbidden and was not performed.
- Unknown/ambiguous authority remains null or unresolved rather than guessed.
- Candidate output is not canonical authority, Work Entry authorization, GVAE receipt, runtime certification, or product readiness.

## 2026-09-04T19:54:52-06:00 — VALIDATION

- `PASS_ZERO_LOSS`: 929 inputs reconciled to 929 outputs.
- Duplicate target IDs: 0.
- Missing target IDs: 0.
- Extra target IDs: 0.
- Closed-vocabulary enum violations: 0.
- Forbidden ambiguous-field violations: 0.
- Candidate writes outside Chat 1 ownership: 0.
- Work branch delta from base: only the five Tablet candidate-shard files.

## 2026-09-04T19:54:52-06:00 — HANDOFF

- Current lane state: `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- Two physical drift records remain explicitly blocked: `TGT.CENSUS.TABLET.3B2FED34BC21B5C9FEEC.V1` and `TGT.CENSUS.TABLET.850AD4CEF4CCD12BCD05.V1`.
- Next step is a bounded comparison of the exact Chat 1 input-authority hashes against current `main`. This is revalidation, not broad rediscovery.

## 2026-09-04T19:57:31-06:00 — FINDING

- Current `main`: `d08013db42c34ccafb80075392ec6d7a289cf7b5`, three commits ahead of Chat 1 base.
- Bounded revalidation checked the exact Chat 1 input authorities only. No recensus and no broad rediscovery were performed.
- All **13/13** authority files pinned in `MANIFEST.json.authoritySnapshots` are byte-identical on current `main` by Git blob SHA.
- The six additional Atlasfin registries used/reviewed by the lane are also byte-identical.
- NDC canon/ID grammar and the unchanged startup authorities (Field Manual, Factory Ledger Agent Gate, Visual Change Master Map, Visual Core Contract) show no relevant drift.
- The changed startup/cohort docs only add the shared status-channel protocol.

## 2026-09-04T19:57:31-06:00 — DECISION

- Base-to-current-main movement is classified as **coordination-only drift** for Chat 1.
- No candidate recomputation, no broad rediscovery and no product/runtime mutation are justified.
- State remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.

## 2026-09-04T19:57:31-06:00 — VALIDATION

- `PASS_BOUNDED_CHAT1_AUTHORITY_EQUIVALENCE`.
- Pinned authority snapshots unchanged: **13/13**.
- Additional Atlasfin registry inputs unchanged: **6/6**.
- Relevant candidate-semantic drift detected: **0**.
- Status-channel governance additions detected: yes, coordination-only.

## 2026-09-04T19:57:31-06:00 — HANDOFF

- Chat 1 original lane work is complete under its worker completion rule.
- No user action is required.
- Integration may consume `chat1/tablet-visual-promotion-57b01ad8@1b669d98dc9063fe4d6f5f8ddc06262a6968e728` with the recorded caveat that the two physical DRIFT records remain blocked conflicts.
- Future Chat 1 work should resume only if a recorded input authority/candidate-semantic contract drifts or canonical integration requests a bounded correction inside the Chat 1 ownership.

## 2026-09-04T19:58:10-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Status-branch isolation check: **PASS**.
- The status branch is based on `d08013db42c34ccafb80075392ec6d7a289cf7b5` and its entire Chat 1 reporting delta touches only:
  - `apps/terminal-de-venta-system/docs/ops/visual-promotion-parallel-status/chat-01-tablet/STATUS.json`
  - `apps/terminal-de-venta-system/docs/ops/visual-promotion-parallel-status/chat-01-tablet/LOG.md`
- Work branch isolation remains **PASS**: exactly five Tablet candidate-shard files, no other lane/product/global-authority writes.

## 2026-09-04T19:58:10-06:00 — COMPLETE

- Chat 1 reporting channel is initialized and current.
- Chat 1 original candidate-promotion work remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- No user action is needed.
- No further worker mutation is justified unless relevant authority drifts or integration requests a bounded Chat 1 correction.

## 2026-09-04T20:13:20-06:00 — PROGRESS

- Re-read the current canonical prompt at `prisma-html/docs/ops/visual-promotion-parallel/PRISMA_VISUAL_PROMOTION_PARALLEL_CHAT_PROMPTS.md`.
- Prompt phase: `INTEGRATION_HANDOFF_AND_PLANNING`.
- Chat 1 continuation mode: **Tablet HOLD**.
- Preserved worker provenance:
  - base: `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`
  - branch: `chat1/tablet-visual-promotion-57b01ad8`
  - head: `1b669d98dc9063fe4d6f5f8ddc06262a6968e728`
  - accounting: `929 = 139 candidates + 788 unresolved + 2 conflicts`
- No recensus, recomputation, candidate mutation, product/runtime mutation or canonical-ID minting is authorized.
- Starting only a bounded read-only revalidation of recorded Chat 1 authority/source inputs against current `main`.

## 2026-09-04T20:14:40-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Current `main`: `66fa02147f0cf31529c090a47f376026b406875a`.
- Current canonical prompt blob: `d9650c43542a89dcf4c6c787f32b36ef83541488`.
- Chat 1 continuation remains **Tablet HOLD** with the same exact base/work refs and accounting.
- Bounded authority revalidation: **PASS**, `13/13` recorded authority snapshots are unchanged by Git blob SHA.
- Worker branch ownership recheck: **PASS**, still only the five owned Tablet candidate-shard files.
- Relevant Chat 1 authority drift: **0**.
- Recensus/recomputation performed: **no**.
- Candidate/product/runtime/global-authority mutation performed: **no**.

## 2026-09-04T20:14:40-06:00 — COMPLETE

- State remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- The two physical DRIFT targets remain conflicts exactly as recorded.
- No user action is required.
- Chat 1 is now holding exactly as the canonical continuation prompt requires.
- Resume only for a material blocker/relevant drift or an explicit evidence-backed bounded correction request from Chat 6/integration.

## 2026-09-04T23:44:00-06:00 — START

- Canonical phase re-read: `CANDIDATE_CORPUS_CERTIFICATION_PARALLEL`.
- Chat 1 assignment: **TABLET CORPUS CERTIFICATION**.
- Previous HOLD is superseded by the new normative override.
- Fresh certification branch created from canonical `main`:
  - branch: `chat1/tablet-corpus-cert-20260904`
  - base/head at creation: `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`
- Immutable source remains:
  - branch: `chat1/tablet-visual-promotion-57b01ad8`
  - head: `1b669d98dc9063fe4d6f5f8ddc06262a6968e728`
  - source base: `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`
  - accounting: `929 = 139 candidates + 788 unresolved + 2 conflicts`
- Write boundary: only `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/tablet/certification/**`.
- No PR and no `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json` update are allowed in this lane.

## 2026-09-04T23:52:00-06:00 — BLOCKER

- Dry-run strict corpus validation reached **928/929 direct-reference PASS**.
- Strict shape and closed vocabulary are **929/929 PASS**.
- Zero-loss remains **929 unique targets** with source buckets **139 / 788 / 2**.
- The sole pending record is `TGT.CENSUS.TABLET.0DC6BC69B3278EC225CE.V1`, the one existing Identity-binding reuse.
- Its `slotId`, `componentId`, `componentUiId` and `ownerId` are not direct expanded Visual Control references. This is not being guessed valid.
- Required proof: exact match against existing authority `BND.ACT.PRIMARY.TABLET.POS.COBRAR.V1`.
- No certification files have been committed while this proof is pending.

## 2026-09-04T23:56:00-06:00 — BLOCKER_CLEARED

- Exact Identity authority read for `BND.ACT.PRIMARY.TABLET.POS.COBRAR.V1`.
- Binding target proves the candidate's `routeId`, `regionId`, `slotId`, `componentUiId`, `ownerId`, selector and `implementationLayerId`.
- Binding `layerId` equals candidate `applicationLayerId`.
- Candidate `componentId` equals the binding-proven `componentUiId`, so no new component identity was inferred.
- The previous direct-census lookup failure was a **reference-domain validation issue**, not a source defect.
- Blocker cleared. Dry-run corpus validity is now **929/929**, with semantic mutation still **0**.

## 2026-09-04T23:59:00-06:00 — VALIDATION

- Final Git read-back result: `PASS_FINAL_TABLET_CORPUS_READBACK`.
- Certification branch: `chat1/tablet-corpus-cert-20260904`.

- Head: `fd111022438bab909151c2220b52e95aa5aa7eb3`.
- Branch delta: exactly **5 files**, all under `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/tablet/certification/`.
- `NORMALIZED.jsonl`: **929** rows.
- `CERTIFICATION.jsonl`: **929** rows.
- `INVALID.jsonl`: **0** rows, empty Git blob.
- Unique normalized targets: **929/929**.
- Source/provenance failures: **0**.
- Normalized record-hash failures: **0**.
- Semantic mutations: **0**.
- Certification labels: **139 VALID_ELIGIBLE_CANDIDATE + 788 VALID_REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST + 2 VALID_BLOCKED**.
- Both physical DRIFT conflicts remain exact `DRIFT / BLOCKED / BLOCKED`.
- The one existing Cobrar binding reuse remains exact and still has Work Entry `REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`.
- Canonical `main` is still `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`; no post-certification drift exists.
- No PR, no `FILES_MANIFEST.json`, no Materiality, no broad rediscovery, no product/runtime or global-authority mutation.

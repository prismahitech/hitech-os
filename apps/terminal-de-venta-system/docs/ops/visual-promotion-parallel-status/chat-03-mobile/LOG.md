# Chat 3 — MOBILE_PROMOTION status log

No updates published yet.

## 2026-09-04T19:50:47-06:00 — START / PROGRESS / FINDING / DECISION / VALIDATION / HANDOFF

- Published first Chat 3 status report under the canonical shared status channel.
- Work base: `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`.
- Work branch/head: `visual-promotion-chat3-mobile-20260904` @ `7f32ce6f1b602a14781fa2f4f3f323035f8029ec`.
- Current main observed: `d08013db42c34ccafb80075392ec6d7a289cf7b5`; work branch is 1 commit ahead and 3 commits behind.
- Candidate shard is complete and isolated to five files under `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/mobile/`.
- Zero-loss accounting PASS: 271 input targets, 271 unique outcomes, 0 missing, 0 extra, 0 duplicate.
- Projection partition PASS: 133 CURRENT, 138 DRIFT.
- Material finding: governed Mobile cleanup commit `731574f97dba0ec46420369b777071500ce2f833` removed retired `.multiContextRoot` from the product dashboard rule while current RIFAT source still carries it. The lane records both a legitimate newer runtime/product candidate and stale canonical-authority candidate without choosing a repair direction.
- Decision: no broad rediscovery, no canonical ID minting, no Materiality fallback, no product/RIFAT/projection repair. All outcomes remain `REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`.
- Current lane state: `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`.
- No user action requested at this time.
- Next: inspect the three commits by which `main` advanced and record whether that drift is relevant to Chat 3 evidence before integration.

## 2026-09-04T19:52:07-06:00 — FINDING / DECISION / BLOCKER_CLEARED / VALIDATION / HANDOFF

- Completed explicit drift review from work base `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09` to current `main` `d08013db42c34ccafb80075392ec6d7a289cf7b5`.
- The three intervening commits changed status-channel/governance coordination only: shared status mailboxes/index, status-channel contract/docs, AGENTS wiring, interoperability/status vocabulary additions, and the corresponding `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json` refresh.
- No Chat 3 Mobile authority/readset or projection evidence path changed: no Mobile Target Index/expanded authority, RIFAT Mobile canonical source, Mobile product projection, visual-source-manifest, Identity registry, NDC registry or Atlasfin registry mutation was present in the delta.
- Validation result: `PASS_NON_RELEVANT_DRIFT` for the completed candidate shard.
- Current Chat 3 prompt/write ownership/output contract remains unchanged; the new status-channel reporting requirement is now satisfied on `status/vp-chat-03-mobile`.
- Decision: do not rewrite/rebase candidate data merely because `main` moved. Preserve original `baseHead` and evidence provenance.
- Handoff remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`. Preferred integration is the single isolated candidate commit `7f32ce6f1b602a14781fa2f4f3f323035f8029ec` applied onto the coordinator's current integration base.
- No user action required. No new blocker.

## 2026-09-04T19:52:46-06:00 — VALIDATION / COMPLETE

- Status-branch isolation validation PASS against current `main` `d08013db42c34ccafb80075392ec6d7a289cf7b5`.
- Exactly two paths differ on `status/vp-chat-03-mobile`: this Chat's `STATUS.json` and append-only `LOG.md`.
- No code, candidate shard, product/runtime, visual authority, global manifest or another Chat mailbox is present in the status-branch delta.
- Chat 3 lane work remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION`; no additional candidate mutation is justified by current evidence.

## 2026-09-04T20:14:00-06:00 — PROGRESS / FINDING / DECISION / VALIDATION / HANDOFF

- Re-read the canonical prompt at current `main` `66fa02147f0cf31529c090a47f376026b406875a` and located assigned **Chat 3 — Mobile Promotion**.
- Current phase is `INTEGRATION_HANDOFF_AND_PLANNING`; normative continuation places Chat 3 in **HOLD**.
- Re-read this Chat's current mailbox and confirmed preserved provenance: work branch `visual-promotion-chat3-mobile-20260904`, work head `7f32ce6f1b602a14781fa2f4f3f323035f8029ec`, base `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`, accounting `271 = 133 CURRENT + 138 DRIFT`.
- Re-read current interoperability contract, vocabulary registry and status-channel contract. Atlasfin remains priority reference; Materiality Catalog remains `STANDBY_USER_INVOKED_ONLY`.
- Latest drift review from prior observed `main` `d08013db42c34ccafb80075392ec6d7a289cf7b5` to current `main` found only two changed paths: the canonical parallel prompt and `prisma-html/FILES_MANIFEST.json`. Result: `PASS_NON_RELEVANT_DRIFT` for Chat 3 evidence.
- Decision: no shard regeneration, no rebase, no RIFAT-vs-product repair choice, no change to the 138 DRIFT classifications, and no change to `REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST` outcomes.
- No candidate/runtime/authority/product mutation performed in this continuation step.
- Chat 3 remains `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` in HOLD, pending only an explicit bounded correction request from Chat 6/integration if deterministic validation finds one.
- No user action required.

## 2026-09-04T23:44:00-06:00 — START / PROGRESS / DECISION

- Re-read the canonical prompt at `main` `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`.
- Current phase is now `CANDIDATE_CORPUS_CERTIFICATION_PARALLEL`; the previous HOLD is superseded.
- Assigned lane is **Chat 3 — Mobile Corpus Certification**.
- Immutable source provenance remains `visual-promotion-chat3-mobile-20260904` @ `7f32ce6f1b602a14781fa2f4f3f323035f8029ec`, source base `57b01ad8bda043ec25763203354b686341bace09`, input `271`.
- Planned certification branch: `chat3/mobile-corpus-cert-20260904` from current canonical main.
- Scope is syntactic/reference normalization only. No semantic upgrade, no projection repair, no RIFAT-vs-product choice, no Materiality use, no product/runtime mutation.
- Lane state changed to `IN_PROGRESS`.

## 2026-09-04T23:59:00-06:00 — FINDING / DECISION / VALIDATION / HANDOFF / COMPLETE

- Created certification branch `chat3/mobile-corpus-cert-20260904` from canonical `main` `8cc1918c5e015d1408335c15313e7364e04859c2`.
- Certification commit: `664035e83943ae48c923585765d3c505b1bd8c53`.
- Wrote exactly five owned outputs under `prisma-html/governance/visual-promotion/candidates/mobile/certification/`: `MANIFEST.json`, `NORMALIZED.jsonl`, `CERTIFICATION.jsonl`, `INVALID.jsonl`, `SUMMARY.md`.
- Strict representation normalization completed for the known Mobile mismatches only: projection flattening, raw domain-scoped NDC refs, strict evidence-ref qualification, and raw Atlasfin adapter ID.
- Original worker bytes remain immutable at `7f32ce6f1b602a14781fa2f4f3f323035f8029ec`; every normalized row pins source file, line and SHA-256 of the original JSONL record.
- Validation PASS: `271/271` normalized, `271/271` certification, unique targets `271`, missing `0`, extra `0`, duplicates `0`, invalid `0`.
- Certification status: `271 VALID_REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`.
- Semantic invariants PASS: `semanticMutationCount=0`; all promotion and Work Entry decisions remain `REGISTER_TARGET_FIRST`.
- Projection partition unchanged: `133 CURRENT + 138 DRIFT`.
- Read-back provenance validation PASS: source-record hash mismatches `0`; normalized-record hash mismatches `0`.
- Reference validation PASS for NDC `SURF.mb.owner_home`, Atlasfin `ADP.MB.TOUCH.V2`, Identity `prisma.adapter.mobile.v1`; strict evidence refs invalid count `0`.
- File digests: `NORMALIZED.jsonl = bfec6c59764f92ed54edd63dd1df4273165044ade95839a92d08930e93703ee1`; `CERTIFICATION.jsonl = 81eb0afbf8c7fa54833ed09f503d2ccf2ee5407c5aed089dcda6bbd75219a287`.
- Branch-scope validation PASS: exactly five changed paths, all inside the Mobile certification root.
- No RIFAT-vs-product repair direction chosen. No broad rediscovery. No Materiality Catalog. No product/runtime/global-authority mutation. No `FILES_MANIFEST.json` refresh. No Chat 3 PR.
- Chat 3 state: `READY_FOR_INTEGRATION` with result `PASS_MOBILE_CANDIDATE_CORPUS_CERTIFIED`.
- Handoff to Chat 6: consume `chat3/mobile-corpus-cert-20260904` @ `664035e83943ae48c923585765d3c505b1bd8c53` as the certified Mobile derivative while preserving raw source provenance `7f32ce6f1b602a14781fa2f4f3f323035f8029ec`.

## 2026-09-11T22:45:00-06:00 — START / PROGRESS

- Re-read current canonical phase from main `7c5b8d477a9006c5184ddbc806874b6e7c02571c`: `CORPUS_FINAL_PARALLEL_VERIFICATION`.
- Resolved Chat 3 lane from STATUS_INDEX: `MOBILE_PROMOTION`, status branch `status/vp-chat-03-mobile`, phase role `MOBILE_FINAL_WITNESS`, expected result `PASS_MOBILE_CORPUS_WITNESS`.
- Final witness source is immutable certification head `664035e83943ae48c923585765d3c505b1bd8c53` on `chat3/mobile-corpus-cert-20260904`.
- Verification starts read-only from exact Git head-tree bytes. No certification/source/product/runtime/global-authority mutation is authorized or planned.
- Materiality Catalog remains uninspected and forbidden for this task.
